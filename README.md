# Builders

![](https://github.com/threefoldtech/builders/blob/development/docs/img/nice_lake.png)

Our aim is to make a set of reprocable builders using vlang.

Our requirements

- easy to read
- easy to extend
- easier to develop than 100+ bash scripts

Documentation on https://github.com/freeflowuniverse/crystallib

> there are a lot of docker examples in https://github.com/threefoldtech/tf-images, look for inspiration there before creating the vbuilders
